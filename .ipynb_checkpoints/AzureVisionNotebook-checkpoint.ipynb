    "The Microsoft Computer Vision API is a state-of-the-art service provided by Microsoft through Azure that enables developers to analyze and retrieve information from images in a very simple way and with little code.  This tutorial will walk you through the basics of using the API in python to produce a list of descriptive words that relate to the image you provide."

    "- Go to https://portal.azure.com and log in to your student account.\n",
    "- Search for \"Computer Vision\" in the menu at the top and select it from the \"Marketplace\" section of results.\n",
    "- Enter a name for your key, leave subscription as \"Azure for Students\", set location to \"(US) West Central US\", set pricing to \"S1\", and either select an existing resource group for your key or make a new one.\n",
    "- Click \"Create\"\n",
    "- Select \"All Resources\" from the left menu and click on the key you created. \n",
    "- Under \"Resource Management\" select \"Keys\" and there are your 2 keys!  Both do the same thing so pick whichever one you like."

Try it out by replacing the text \"IMAGE-URL-GOES-HERE\" with a URL of an image from somewhere on the internet (make sure that it is the images URL, not a webpage).  The function will ask for your API key each time you run it so have it handy to copy and paste into the input field that appears."
